    "   - If the profiles are public, we can try connecting with them and sending a polite message inquiring about their income for research purposes. However, this approach may not yield many responses.\n",

    "vii). **Statistical Analysis**:\n",
    "    - If we have a large dataset of LinkedIn profiles, we can perform statistical analysis to estimate income ranges based on available data points like location, job title, and industry."
